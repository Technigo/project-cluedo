# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

In this project we were focused on working with arrays, each-loops and objects in Javascript.

## The problem

The problem or the solution depends on how you want to see it was to place all characters in different objects and them call them out. 

What I did in this project was to create objects in the array and them added them in functions to make it easier to call them out instead of naming each one of the characters. 

If I had more time, then I would style my project more and also clean up the final code on step for.
