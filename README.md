# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This was a school project for Technigo, where the task was to make a murder mystery generator.

## The problem

The trickiest part was to make the random selector for the cards, I used Stackoverflow to put the pieces together. It was difficult but a fun project! If I had more time I would make the site responsive.
