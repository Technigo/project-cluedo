# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

A Cluedo SPA where you randomly pick a killer, weapon and room, store them in a mystery object which is revealed when clicking a button.

I planned the different functions and events by discussing different approaches, before starting to code. When coding I discovered I love making the code clean and future proof - it should not only work but also be able to handle larger objects, arrays and number of elements.
