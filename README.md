# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This was a project at the Technigo Bootcamp. The project was to create a classic Cluedo game using Javascript functions, arrays and objects. 

# Tech used ðŸ§ 

- Javascript
- HTML & CSS

# Requirements ðŸ§ª

- Site should have three clickable cards and a clickable button.
- You should be able to randomly pick suspects, weapons and rooms.
- You should be able to reveal the mystery.

# The problem

If I had more time on this project, I would definitely improve how the site is responsive to smallers screens as well as making the sentences adapted to each person, room, weapon and room.
