## What did I do?

I started with a sketch for my design. Then I created the objects I needed to store information for each card type.
I connected functions for picking a suspect, weapon and murderer to the cards. I also made a function for revealing the mystery. The mystery will only be revealed if he user has picked one card of each type.
