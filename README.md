# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo.The user and game leader is able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. When clicking the button "Reveal the mystery" a message pops up with the information about the murder.

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

I started with styling the page. Then I went on to creating the objects for suspects, weapons and rooms.
