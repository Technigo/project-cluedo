# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project is a Cluedo game. There are 3 cards and by clicking on each of them you can see a suspect, a weapon and a room where the crime was commited.
When all the cards are open there is a button which you can click and it reveals the mistery in a displayed sentence.

## The problem

1. Created functions for picking cards and displaying information on them.
2. Created a function when onclick of the Reveal button the mystery message appears, added if else condition so that if the cards are not open the mystery won't be revealed.
   3)Created the favourite weapon function for random dispaly of favorite weapons of the supects.
   I am planning to add the loader animation to each card as well.
