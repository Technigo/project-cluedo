`PROJECT 5`

# Build a piece of Cluedo

This week's been all about Javascript, learning about arrays and objects. An it was hooked up with some html and css!

**So - This project is to create a piece of the famous board game [Cluedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo).**


## What I learned 🧠

- Create and manipulate objects
- Create arrays
- More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript

**_Requirements 🧪 and Design_**
- Code follows Technigo’s code guidelines.
- You should be able tothree clickable cards and a clickable button.
- You should be able torandomly pick suspects, weapons and rooms.
- You should be able to reveal the mystery.
- Responsive.
- it looks nice.
- images of your suspects and tested icons the weapons from a Library called Noun Project https://thenounproject.com/.
- Add the functionality to say something like: "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet.
