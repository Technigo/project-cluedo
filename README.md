# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Week 5 in technigo bootcamp, the project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. The aim was to practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

## The problem

This week was hard as a start, but I feel that I need more practice to really understand everthing. If I had more time I would have practice and tested more. I would have added more design and a made it responsive to different screen sizes.
