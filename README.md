# Project 5 - Cluedo
Project week 5 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019 was to create a piece from the classic board game Cluedo. <br>

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.
