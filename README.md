# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is a javascript Murder Mystery game.
The assignment was to create a cluedo-game consisting of three cards with suspects and weapons.
I added a little story-card to help the user set the mood.

## The problem

I had two problems during this project that I really got stuck on. 
Firstly I had a problem understanding and getting my shuffle-function to work. I approached the problem by consulting my teammates and they helped me through the process.

Secondly I had a problem with getting my images to fit within my div-container.
This was solved by posting a question on Stack Overflow and getting help that way. It turned out I could use the object-fit attribute in CSS (Which I actually have used on a previous project).
