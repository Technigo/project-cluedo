Project week 5 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2019 was to create a piece from the classic board game Cluedo.

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.
