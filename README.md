# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This was a programming project in week 5 of Technigo Bootcamp. The focus of this assignment was to use and understand arrays, objects and functions better. 

## The problem

I started with creating the objects and then the arrays. The next step was to write all the functions and then to apply those functions to the objects or arrays. With more time I would as always make the styling nicer.
