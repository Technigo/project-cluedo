# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

My goal this week was to get the most basic (blue level) features in order and prevent the stress I felt last week. 
 
â€“ next time I would definitely have focused on heading the red and black level. But I'm happy the game looks quite ok, after all. 

## The problem

My focus was: trying to understand javascript and become better at googling these topics and filter between the results. I started to get all the basic (blue level) functions in order. 
If i had more time I would try red and black level and also style the cards more.
