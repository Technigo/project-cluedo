# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo by creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I have a hard time to write down the javascript from scratch. It have not landed in me jet. But i started to fill out all the suspects, weapons and rooms, and those arrys and objects i get, that part and construct i understand. For the other half i got help from an old cluedo project so i could looka att the cod and understand it and then change it from there. I styled the cluedo board game and put images in for the weapon to. I did a favicon also.
