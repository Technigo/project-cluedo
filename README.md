# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

https://festive-haibt-e39877.netlify.app/

The assignment this week was to create a version of the board game Cluedo, making use of arrays and objects as well as connecting and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

I started with deconstructing the project to see what kinds of input and output would be requried. I also visualized the user structure: first this happens, and then this etc.. to get an idea of what the end product would look like. I read up on objects, arrays and loops. I also tried to learn more about functions in functions, and then started to code.

I created arrays and arrays of objects for the three main categories: suspects, weapon and room. I used Math.random to generate random items and connect these in a final reveal mystery-button. The same Math.random- method was used to randomise each killer's favourite weapon and to be able to output this in the browser.

In order to get a loader working for each card click I used add/remove eventlistener, and manipulated the the DOM to output the flow I was after. I could not solve the second card click which brought back the loader but did not hide the results from the first click.

I made the site responsive using flex box and media query.
