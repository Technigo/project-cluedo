# Clue & do 🕵️‍♀️ - Mystery Randomizer

Random mystery picker inspired in the classic board game Cluedo®. 
The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to "reveal" the mystery.

The focus of this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.



## Planning & The problem 🧩

I've started by building the card decks by styling them and then create all the object lists and the arrays, I wanted all to show details and images about the suspect, weapon and room respectively so I changed my object lists to reflect that when the functions are called. 
When the user clicks on each deck a card will be displayed by calling a function which will randomly select from the arrays a "killer", "weapon" and "room" a card will be displayed. I've also added a function to random generate a "killer's favourite weapon. 

Then there's a "Reveal mystery" button that once the cards mentioned above have been clicked will manipulate the DOM by JavaScript and reveal the mystery.
