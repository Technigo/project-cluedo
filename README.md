# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

In this assignment I created a Cluedo game that randomly choose a killer, a weapon and a crime scene and displayed these when clicking different cards. It would also contain a button that revealed the crime and showed that in a statement on the screen. 

## The problem


I looked at all of the course material. Read through the assignment closely in order to understand it. Tried to follow every step but got a bit excited and forgot to push commits to git in the beginning. Took advantage of my team mates question and answers on Slack on how to solve certain issues. I also had an issue with the Terminal and asked on Stack overflow.
I got it to work and feel that I understand how I got it to work. If I had more time I would have done the stretch goals to make it look nicer.
