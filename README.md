# A piece of the famous board game Cluedo

Practicing working with objects and arrays, and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. I wanted the user to be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. And then create a button to reveal the mystery.

Built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Since I remember Cluedo as a sweet game (in spite of the murder part...) I decided to go for a design that is rather cute and retro, than scary.
