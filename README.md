My fifth project as a student at the Technigo boot camp. In this project I've learned more about functions, arrays and objects - like how to create and manipulate objects and arrays - but also how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.

# Build a piece of Cluedo

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there is also a button to reveal the mystery.  
The user can click on the cards to get a new character, weapon or room.
