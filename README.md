# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Here's a, sort of, game of Cluedo. There's tre decks of cards and one button, all clickable. The card gives you a murderer, a weapon and a room and the reveal button gives you a summary of the murder. If you don't have all the cards there's no mystery to solve :) 

## The problem

It felt like I had a much calmer approach to problems this week. I think it is mostly becouse I didn't even look at the red level things before I was done with the blue level. I think that made me calmer and not so overwhealmed. A lot thanks to my team as well, we have talked a lot about the pressure we put ourself in. 
Will take this way of thinking with me to next week aswell and hopefully troughout the course!
