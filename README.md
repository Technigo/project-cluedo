# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This aim of the project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. The objective was to practice creating objects and arrays, and to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. 

## The problem

The main focus of the project was to practice JavaScript, therefore my main approach was to get everything on the page working and responding as desired. To do this I practiced creating arrays and objects and understanding how to manipulate them. To practice my JavaScript I added a functionality to show the message; "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet. Lastly I worked on the styling and making the site responsive. If I had more time I would have liked to add some extra functions to for example "close/turn back" the cards and have different styling of the cards when turned vs. not turned.
