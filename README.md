# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This site is made based on the popular game Cluedo

## The problem

To create this game I had to write multilpe functions that would work with objects and arrays. Also I had to randomize item selection from the arrays. Often I had to debug my code with the help of debugger tool and console.log. When I got stucked with ideas or soultions I used Google and StackOverflow. In this project I mostly used JS, if I had more time I would concentrate on styling the page.
