# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This week's project is to create a cluedo project picker.

## The problem
The most challenging was definately the JavaScript part. 
First I looked at the Technigo-material for this week at Canvas, done the labs, to be more prepared. Then forked the repository and looked at the code and tasks. Googled a lot and find solutions as well as testing/playing around. Also the demosession and repo with my teammates made me inspired and got me inputs/help with my problems.

 If I had more time I would like to add more code to make it more like a real game and more visual effects as well as more JavaScript effects, and more styling.
