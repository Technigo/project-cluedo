# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

- Site should have three clickable cards and a clickable button.
- You should be able to randomly pick suspects, weapons and rooms.
- You should be able to reveal the mystery.

I finsihed the blue level for this project. I wish I would have started with the styling a bit earlier so i could have put more time into the cards when they've been clicked.

## The problem

I'm still struggling to understand even the basics of JavaScript, which makes it very difficult for me to come up with the code on my own (in CSS I can try different things until I find the right solution, but in JS I don't know yet what to try). I managed to complete this tasks by looking at other peoples code, and with help from my teammates.

## What I learned

When I look at this code, even though I might not be able to come up with it all on my own yet, I understand this better than the pizza-bot project. So I guess I've learned a bit even though I may not think so.
