# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

 This week’s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Clueado by creating objects and arrays  
## The problem


I have a hard time to write the javascript from scratch by myself at this point. Lucky for me you guys had started the Cluedo game for me and I started to put in all the info in the arrays and objects. Then I search and found some code that fits the project and I tried to turn the code to ”my own”. 
I put in picture for the weapons and styled the page with a blood button and sm frames for all the diffrent images. If i would have more time i would try to manage the red and black level.
