# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The focus on this project was to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. I created a version of the board game Cluedo in which different arrays and objects were combined in order to randomise a killer, a weapon and a room. The site is responsive, it has an animation loader (sort of) and a function that randomises favourite weapons (besides the other functions randomising killer, weapon and room). I also have added a play-again-button.

## The problem

I started with deconstructing the project and tried to define what the required inputs and outputs would be, and how the actual user flow would look like. Then I read and viewed the learning material, and eventually got started with coding. I tried not to get ahead of myself and also to read the instructions closely. 

It was frustrating since I kept looking at the red and black requirements which I thought were really hard. So instead of solidifying the blue level I rushed on to the more advanced levels. I'm not sure this is a good approach since I end up feeling that I don't really know anything. Thankfully, as in earlier projects, my team (and others in other teams) have been very supportive and helpful.
