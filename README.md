# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Creating a Cluedo game using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3, that will reveal a crime with a random suspect, weapon and room 🕵️‍♀️🃑🧠🔪

## Code
I've used:
  * **JavaScript**
  * **CSS**
  * **HTML**
  * **Flexbox**

## The problem

Started creating objects for every suspect that would contain info to show on the killer card and proceeded to do the same for the weapon. Kept the rooms just in the array at start and added object as I went on and felt more confident in my code and functions.

Put the onclick in the HTML which makes much more sense to me since I think it's easier to read and interput. I can see the function invoke and exactly where I want it. 

Made functions for all of the cards that would insert a random choice and therefore create random murders. These would be revealed when clicking the button called "reveal the crime". I chose to replace the entire body with the final message and I like the result eventhough I'm not completely satisfied with the responsive parts. Escpecially the tablet design but I needed to put a stop and not fixate on details. It works and that's what's important. 

I feel like I got a more complete understanding of how I use and import JavaScript in HTML and that feeling is so soothing and empowering. Gaining some code confidence this week and I really enjoyed this project too.
If I had more time, or energy above all, I would love to have styled the media queries more and found some other deisgn solutions since the JS parts worked so smoothly.
