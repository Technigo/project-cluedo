Im going too have to see my self done for now. Still alot more i could've done but unfortunately dont have time to get stuck on this project. I whent with the basic style. Im pretty happy about understanding more about javascript. Im going to try and come back to this when i get time.

Note to self. dont take on to much work when youre studying in this pase.
