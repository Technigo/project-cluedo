# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is a the game cluedo. It randomizes a mystory for the players to solve.

## The problem

Step one was to create the constant objects. After that the button for randomizing objects was activated. When this worked well in the console and the results where made visible in the dom with javascript. The cards got separate triggers to get random object individually. The problem I found was that if a user clicks on the cards it where not kept in memory for the revealation button to show matching values. This is what I would fix if I had more time. I will add images and styling to this project and make it responsive.
