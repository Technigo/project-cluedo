`PROJECT 5`
# Build a piece of Cluedo
Project built in the Technigo boot camp, starting Sprint 2.
The focus in this project was to learn more about Javascript, how to use arrays, objects and functions. The objective was to create functions that randomly picks values from the Killer, Room and Weapon objects when clicking on each card, resulting in revealing a mystery.
