# Cluedo Mystery Randomizer - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp. 

Learning objectives:
1. Create and manipulate objects
2. Create arrays
3. More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript

# Brief
This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. 
You'll practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to "reveal" the mystery.

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## Approach
Clue is a favorite of mine (more the movie than the actual game), so to me the feel of Cluedo is light-hearted and sometimes goofy. I knew I wanted the styling of the page to go in that direction and I wanted things to be cute if not a bit cartooney. Having this in mind, I chose this week to focus on working out the functions in JavaScript first. This was a good strategy since knowing that the styling bit can easily get me sidetracked. My goal is always to deliver a page which appears clean and simple even if there's a huge jumble of code happening in the background and I feel that I hit the mark this week.
