# Build a piece of Cluedo / see the result here: https://mrsucodesproject5thecluedogame.netlify.com/

This site is all about Javascript, arrays and objects. Off course some html and css too!

**So - Created a modern type of the famous board game [Cluedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo).**

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.  

The focus on this site is the practice of objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## Step 1 - I created the objects for suspects, weapons and rooms.

The suspects and the weapons have several details about them whilst the rooms only has a name.

**The suspects**
 Mr Green - Jacob Green
 Professor Plum - Victor Plum
 Miss Scarlet - Cassandra Scarlet
 Mrs Peacock - Eleanor Peacock
 Colonel Mustard - Jack Mustard
 Mrs White - Mrs White
 
**The Weapons**
Rope
Knife
Candlestick
Dumbbell
Poison
Axe
Bat
Trophy
Pistol

**The Rooms**
Dinning Room
Conservatory
Kitchen
Study
Library
Billiard Room
Lounge
Ballroom
Hall
Spa
Living Room
Observatory
Theater
Guest House
Patio


## Step 2 - I created arrays to group together suspects, weapons and rooms.

## Step 3 - To be able to pick a murderer, a weapon and a room

By clicking on the cards, I invoke the right functions to pick a murderer, a room and a weapon. 
That's stored in the mysterty object and I visually see the chosen cards in the browser.

## Step 4 - Reveal the mystery

When clicking the button Reveal Mystery, I see a message saying something like:
*The murder was committed by Jacob Green, in the living room with a rope.*
