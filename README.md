# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer
In this project I've created part of a Cluedo game using objects and arrays. 

## The problem
It was my first time working with objects and arrays and it went very well. I didn't run in to any problems exept when I tried to use the images from each object to collaborate with the function of each article. I had to spend some time searching for my answer about how to replace an image with a new image using JavaScript. After a while I found the .src DOM that I could use for that and it worked perfectly fine. I used objects for each article (suspects, weapons and rooms) because I wanted to include a picture with all of the different objects. Then I put the variables of the objects into three different arrays. To save the randomized articles, I created an empty object where I stored the information later on. If I had more time on this project I would have made my site more responsive, even though the site already adjust it self to three different screen sizes.
