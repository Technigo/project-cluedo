# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

I built a Randomizer page for the game Cluedo as a Javascript practice for the Technigo bootcamp.

## The problem

I struggled a lot because none of the onclick function worked and I didn't understand what was causing the problem. To solve the problem I asked my teammates, and posted my problem at Stack Overflow. The suggestion didn't work either so I finally took it to 1:1 consultation with one of our teachers at Technigo, where we found out that a error due to a line of code (where I simply wanted to console.log the one of the elements in a array but instead treated the element as an object) prior to the onclick functions prevented all the code after the error from working. So it wasn't exactly a problem related to function, but me not knowing that the lines of code that comes after an error could be affected by the error and therefore not work.
