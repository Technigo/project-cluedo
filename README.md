# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer
This weekâ€™s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo.
The focus for the project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

This week was all about learning how to work with arrays, objects and how to get functions working together. 

I've spent a lot of hours trying to figure out how to shuffle the favourite weapon, but unfortunately I couldn't make it work the way I wanted it to. BUT this really motivated me to learn more about foreach loops and arrays and resulted in many hours of googling and researching. 

I also struggled a bit with the loading animation 
- loading on click.
- disappearing when the animation was done.
- replacing the loading animation with the information on the card.
However I managed to solve it with the setTimeout method in javascript, after a lot of googling and some help from StackOverflow.
