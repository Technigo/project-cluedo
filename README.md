# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer
This project is done as a part of Technigo boot camp. This weekâ€™s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo.
The focus for the project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## The project

This week was all about learning how to work with arrays, objects and how to get functions working together. 

I also struggled a bit with the loading animation 
- loading on click.
- disappearing when the animation was done.
- replacing the loading animation with the information on the card.
However I managed to solve it with the setTimeout method in javascript, after a lot of googling and some help from StackOverflow.
