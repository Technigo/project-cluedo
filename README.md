## Project 4: Cluedo game. Mistery revealed. 

This project is a Cluedo game. There are 3 cards and by clicking on each of them you can see a suspect, a weapon and a room where the crime was commited.
When all the cards are open there is a button which you can click and it reveals the mistery in a displayed sentence.

## The process

1. Created functions for picking cards and displaying information on them.
2. Created a function when onclick of the Reveal button the mystery message appears, added if else condition so that if the cards are not open the mystery won't be revealed.
3.Created the favourite weapon function for random display of favorite weapons of the supects.

## Focus
* JavaScript functions
* Hook the JavaScript parts up with the HTML 
 
## Challenges to solve

 I am planning to add a loader animation to each card.
