# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Here's a, sort of, game of Cluedo. There's tre decks of cards and one button, all clickable. The card gives you a murderer, a weapon and a room and the reveal button gives you a summary of the murder. If you don't have all the cards there's no mystery to solve :) 

## The problem

It felt like I had a much calmer approach to problems this week. A lot thanks to my team as well, we have talked a lot about the pressure we put ourself in and helped each other when we got stuck in the process. 
Will take this way of thinking with me to next week aswell and hopefully troughout the course!
