# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The assignment was to create a cluedo game. I enjoyed this project, it was fun and challenging.

## The problem

I had problems at first with the structure of the javascript, but by watching your videos I got the hang of it. I just had to think what is the most logical in the situation, that helped me a lot. The codealongs with Jennie was helpful as well. My group helped me a lot also, they showed me how to think about the structure, since it was hard in the beginning for me.

If I did it again, I wished I had more time doing the strech goals, since I was a fun project and wanted to learn more. But i'm happy on how it turned out.
