# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

### This project was made as part of Technigoâ€™s front-end developer boot camp Fall 2020.

This project is a recreation of the board game Cluedeo. The user (the game leader), is able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there is a button to "reveal" the mystery.
