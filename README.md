# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is weeks assignment was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. We were suppose to create three different cards containing: 
- a killer, 
- a murder weapon,
- and aroom where the murder took place. 

The purpose of this assignment was to practice on how to create arrays and objects and connect them to the DOM. 


## The problem

The problem I run into this week was when I started to work with red and black level. I found it hard to create the shuffle weapon function, I recieved undefind message first. I solve the problem by trubbleshoot this with my classmate, it turned out that I had misspelled variable used.
