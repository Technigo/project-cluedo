# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Week 5/23 of Technigo front-end bootcamp the assign were to create a cluedo game, where to randomize cards and weapons. 

## The problem

I am one of those who never ever had heard of cluedo before, so that was the very first step. I found this challenge very fun, I enjoyed the javascript part of it even though it was pretty hard. I manage to solve both to shuffle the killers favourite weapon, as well as implement javascript animations which I planned to do last if everything else went well. 
If I had more time I would defenetly have invested it into the CSS part and developed the entire experience the visitor gets when entering the site.
