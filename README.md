Project Cluedo

This is the cards from the classic game cluedo. The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) clicks on the three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then press the button to reveal the mystery.  

In this project I have used javascript objects and arrays and also used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM .

If I would of had more time I would of added CSS to make the cards flip, put Icons on the rooms, and also made the page responsive and accessible.
