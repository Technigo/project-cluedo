# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The aim of this week's project was to pick a mystery for a Cluedo board game.

We had to randomly pick a card from three different decks and display the mystery, which included information from each card picked.

## The problem

I started off by doing all the steps described in the project brief and once they were finished, I started sketching the design of the webpage.
 
I used icons8 website to get the favicon and Adobe color to pick a color palette.

If I had more time, I would style the website more thoroughly and implement few more functions: 
- one that would display an error mesage if not all 3 cards were picked at the same time 
- one to reset the webpage and start over
- add a loading animation.
