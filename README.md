# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This aim of the project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. The objective was to practice creating objects and arrays, and connecting them to the DOM.

## The problem

The main focus of the project was to continue working with Javascript, so my main approach was to get everything on the page working and responding as desired. Thereafter I focused on expanding the arrays and objects. Lastly I worked on the styling and making the site responsive. If I had more time I would have liked to add some extra functions to for example "close/turn back" the cards and have different styling of the cards when turned vs. not turned.
