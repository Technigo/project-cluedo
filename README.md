# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project was about creating a version of the game Cluedo and using Javascript functions, arrays and objects in order to create interactivity. There are three card decks that represent suspects, weapons and rooms and the user has to be able to click on each set of cards to get a suspect, weapon and a room card with descriptions. Each time you click on a card a new object has to show. Then there is a reveal mystery button which displays a killer and how the murder happened.


## The problem

I started creating objects for each catergory and arrays with the objects created. Then I did the functions so that each time you click the card the different properties of random objects would display on the card such as description, age, image etc. And I created the mystery object with empty properties where the properties of each iteration of picking cards were stored. Then I did the reveal mystery function that would show a string based on the cards clicked once you click the reveal mystery button. After that I created a shuffle favourite weapon function that would change favourite weapons of the suspects each time you click on the suspect cards. Finally I added som loaders that would load each time you click on a card. The tools were JS functions, objects and arrays. If I had more time I would have created a help button so the user could click on it to get game instructions. I would have also done more styling and maybe add cool animations and perhaps a spooky background video to give a murder mystery vibe.
