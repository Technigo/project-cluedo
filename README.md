## In this project you will find:

- JavaScript objects and arrays
- DOM manipulation using Javascript

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning 🔨

I have built a piece of the famous board game Cluedo by the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) can click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there is also a button to reveal the mystery.
