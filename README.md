`PROJECT 5`

# Build a piece of Cluedo

I created a site which is inspired by the famous board game Cluedo.
It has been all about Javascript, learning about arrays and objects and we hooked it up with some html and css in this project!
The focus on this project was to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## Requirements 🧪

- Code follows Technigo’s code guidelines.
- Site should have three clickable cards and a clickable button.
- You should be able to randomly pick suspects, weapons and rooms.
- You should be able to reveal the mystery.
- If selected; demo your solution for your team.

## Stretch Goals 🏃‍♂

Make sure you've commited and pushed a version of your project before starting with the stretch goals.

**_Design_**

- Make the site responsive.
- Spend some time to make it look nice.
- Add images of your suspects and maybe the weapons.

**_Deep-dive_**

- Add the functionality to say something like: "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet.
- Add a fourth deck of card, maybe about when the murder was commited.
