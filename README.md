# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

We practiced more javaScript with focus on objects and arrays.

## The problem

My main problem is figuring out exactly what I want to do so I can be better att finding solutions on google. I had some problems with the last step, adding the revealbutton. In that case I thought it would be trickier than it was. 
We helped each other out in our group and that was great.

The next thing I would have done if I had some more time would be to add a start-over-button instead of just adding the refresh thing to the header. And also make the site responsive.
