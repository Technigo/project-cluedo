# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

In this assignment I created a Cluedo game that randomly choose a killer, a weapon and a crime scene and displayed these when clicking different cards. It also contains a button that reveal the crime and shows that in a statement on the screen. 

## The problem

I first looked at all of the course material and did the tricky practices. I then read through the assignment closely in order to understand it. Tried to follow every step but got a bit excited and forgot to push commits to git in the beginning. Took advantage of my team mates questions and answers on Slack on how to solve certain issues. I also had an issue with the Terminal and asked on Stack overflow.
I got it to work and feel that I understand how I got it to work. If I had more time I would have done the stretch goals to make it look nicer.
