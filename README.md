# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This was a project I did while attending the Technigo frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. The purpose with the project was to practice Javascript, creating objects and arrays and also connect them to the DOM.

## The problem

We got help with some pre-written code with the material and were therefore able to copy that code to add features. I didnÂ´t experience so much trouble with this particular project. If I had more time, I would experimented more with Javascript functions and how to use that to change the content in the HTML.
