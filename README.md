Project Cluedo

This is the cards from the classic game cluedo. The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) clicks on the three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then press the button to reveal the mystery.  

In this project I have used javascript objects and arrays and also to manipulated the DOM with JavaScript.

If I would of had more time I would of added images to the room-cards.
