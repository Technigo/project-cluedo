# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This weekâ€™s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. 
While practicing creating objects and arrays and also connect to the DOM.

## The problem

Didn't have enough time to try the advanced levels so it is very basic. 
Would have loved to make it more interaktive with effects and animations.
