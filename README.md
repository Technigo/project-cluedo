# Cluedo Mystery Randomizer - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp. 

Learning objectives:
1. Create and manipulate objects
2. Create arrays
3. More about manipulating the DOM using Javascript

# Brief
This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. 
You'll practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to "reveal" the mystery.

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.
