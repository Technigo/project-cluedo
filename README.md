# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Technigo Project 5, creating a Cluedo mystery picker. The game leader is able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room.

## The problem

The suspects, weapons and rooms are stored in objects grouped together in three separate arrays. JavaScript is used to randomly pick the killer, weapon and room by clicking the different cards and in turn store them in a mystery object. The mystery object is in turn used to reveal the mystery in a message.
