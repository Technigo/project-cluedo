# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is the fifth assignment in Technigo's bootcamp. It is a Cluedo game randomizer to reveal a the killer, the weapon and the place for the murder mystery.

## The problem

There are three deck of cards that are arrays with objects that contain the information about the objects. The objects are randomized by clicking on the cards. When all cards are clicked you can press the reveal button to show the mystery. To change the HTML to present the objects DOM is used.
