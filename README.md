# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is a the game cluedo. It randomizes a mystory for the players to solve.

## The problem

Step one was to create the constant objects. Later on the button for randomizing objects was added. When this worked well in the console the results where made visible in the dom with javascript. I will add images and styling to this project.
