CLUEDO PROJECT

Kept the design simple with no extras like hover effect etc.
Since the javascript is still a challenge I haven't got everything in place ( The mystery is yet to be solved-message).

There are still a few issues to handle:
CSS:
- the header and white bord isn't going straight out to the right edge.
- same with footer but left margin
- no space between the cards in mobile version, and the cards are squeezed
JS:
- when clickin on the reveal-button without chosing a card the message "The murder was committed by undefined undefined, in the [object HTMLDivElement] with a undefined." shows
