# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

In this project I've created a game where the user can randomly pick a card fork suspects, weapons and rooms. When the user click on the reveal- button after clicking the three cards - a message about the killer is displayed.
## The problem

I createded arrays with objects for the different elemnts - suspects, weapons and rooms. The the program sends the arrays to a randomizer funtion that "shuffles" the card. There is also a function that randomises the suspects favourite weapons.
