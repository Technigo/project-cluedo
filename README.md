# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This was a project at the Technigo Bootcamp. The project was to create a classic Cluedo game using Javascript functions, arrays and objects. 

## The problem

If I had more time on this project, I would definitely improve how the site is responsive to smallers screens as well as making the sentences adapted to each person, room, weapon and room.
