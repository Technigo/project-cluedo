# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Week 5: The focus on this weeks project is to practice objects and arrays and how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
The theme was the mystery game Cluedo and we had to create objects for the Suspects, Weapons and Rooms and then organise these into arrays.
We had to create a function for each card set to randomise the cards and then display that selected card on the website. With the final part being the big mystery reveal! 

## The problem

I started by created the objects and then organising the objects into arrays. Once I had my shuffle functions I began to look at the optional red requirements. Such as creating a favourite weapon property and also a function to make this randomly selected.

## View it live

For this project I focused on the JavaScript side and did not make my site fully screen size responsive.
