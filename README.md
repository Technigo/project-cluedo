# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This is a project I made when doing the Technigo bootcamp (autumn 2020). The project was to practice creating objects and arrays by creating the classic board game Cluedo. 

The game lets you pick three different cards with clues to a committed murder. When you have picked the clues, you reveal the crime by submitting a button. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
