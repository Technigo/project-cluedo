# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Project Cluedo was a challenge of how we used our mind to get the results we wanted by randomising the results.
It was a great help that we had some of the code in so that we could work and focus on the logic of the assignment

## The problem

It was a straightforward request on the blue level and I feel we made it happen by having our fundamentals strong. I did go back to the online class recordings to figure some of my problems out
