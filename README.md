# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

So, our job was that build a mystery picker to find something or someone and pick randomly. 

## The problem

The first problem to find out how to make functions what are working together and actually it was quite helpful that I grabbed paper and pen and draw/write how I imagine the problem and fix it. So sometime go back to the past and dont be afraid of using paper and pen.(:
