# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This week we created a classic boardgame, cluedo. The focus of this project was to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## The problem

I made a mistake when creating some of the object where made a mistake with a punctuation mark but I found it quickly and could move on with the coding.
