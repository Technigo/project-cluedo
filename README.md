# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp. 
The task was to practice objects, arrays and manipulating the DOM using Javascript

## The problem

I started with creating all the objects and arrays. 
Then i created a function for each "cluedo card" that is called when the card is clicked. 
The reveal mystery button will show the mystery by printing out html on the page using Javascript.

Later i created a function to shuffle the mystery killers favourite weapon. I did the mistake of creating
a correct function but placed it wrong. And a working function in the wrong place is just not really usefull. I got help using both slack and stackOverflow to find the right placement. 

I choose to have a basic design and just added some gradients on the cards, a box shadow and hover effect.
I if i had more time i would add a pre loader to my cards.
