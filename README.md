# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

In this project I've created a game where the user can randomly pick a card fork suspects, weapons and rooms. When the user click on the reveal- button after clicking the three cards - a message about the killer is displayed.
## The problem

I createded arrays with objects for the different elemnts - suspects, weapons and rooms. The the program sends the arrays to a randomizer funtion that "shuffles" the card. There is also a function that randomises the suspects favourite weapons.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
