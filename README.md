# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Mission was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo.

## The problem

I started to look through the mission brief, and them worked my way through the project. I got stuck but got help from a teammate. We talked through the code and then I saw the solution and was able to move along.

Just a little bit of styling and responsiveness added in the end.

I coded in VS Code, used Live Server to update and the Inspector in Chrome to view code and functions. I used google fonts and an images from Unsplash/Google.

If I hade more time I would like to put in more design elements and other functions like other messages, buttons and so.
