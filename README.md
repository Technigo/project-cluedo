This was the first project of the second sprint on the Technigo Frontend Bootcamp, which was focused on Javascript.

## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this assignment was to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and for that building a webpage that would mimic Cluedo.
The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. There should also be a button to reveal the mystery.

These were some suggestions for stretch goals and a deep-dive in this project:

* Make the site responsive.
* Spend some time to make it look nice.
* Add images of your suspects and maybe the weapons.
* Add the functionality to say something like: "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet.
* Add a fourth deck of card, maybe about when the murder was commited.

## 2. What did I do?

For this project my plan was to build the entire structure on html first and only then I've styled it. 
I've used flexbox as asked for this assignment to layout the webpage and CSS media queries to control the webpage structure on different devices.
That become hard to control after a while, so in the future I would start by building blocks and style them after they are done. 

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
