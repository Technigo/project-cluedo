# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The task was to make functions to pick a killer, a weapon, and a room for a game of cluedo and then connect this to the DOM so it became visiable in the Html. The killer,weapon and rooms where to be picked from objects and arrays that we made.

## The problem

Once I understood how to connect the html with the js it was pretty straight forward. I wrote my objects slightly different than the others, but according to Jennie in a correct way. I think though, that if I would go further with the project, adding more images etc, it might have been easier to do it in the way the others had done it.
