# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

With the help of instructions from Technigo, I have created a cluedo game where you can choose killer, weapon, room and finally reveal the mystery

## The problem

Blue level was quite explanatory with the instructions, thank you for that. 

I got a better understanding of how to use getElementById, which is nice!

I have some issues with understanding loops and I will put some focus so that I do not fall behind
