This was another project built under the Technigo Frontend Developer Bootcamp. Below you can find the instructions for it, as well as its stretch goals and deep dive steps.

# Build a piece of Cluedo

The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.  

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

## Step 1 - Create the objects for suspects, weapons and rooms.

The suspects and the weapons have several details about them whilst the rooms only has a name.

**The suspects**
 Mr Green - Jacob Green
 Professor Plum - Victor Plum
 Miss Scarlet - Cassandra Scarlet
 Mrs Peacock - Eleanor Peacock
 Colonel Mustard - Jack Mustard
 Mrs White - Mrs White
 
**The Weapons**
Rope
Knife
Candlestick
Dumbbell
Poison
Axe
Bat
Trophy
Pistol

**The Rooms**
Dinning Room
Conservatory
Kitchen
Study
Library
Billiard Room
Lounge
Ballroom
Hall
Spa
Living Room
Observatory
Theater
Guest House
Patio

## Step 2 - Create arrays to group together suspects, weapons and rooms.

Try to console log the arrays to see that everyhting is there.

## Step 3 - Pick a murderer, a weapon and a room

When clicking on the cards, you should invoke the right functions to pick a murderer, a room and a weapon. 
That should be stored in the mysterty object and we should visually see the chosen cards in the browser.

## Step 4 - Reveal the mystery

When clicking the button Reveal Mystery, we should see a message saying something like:
*The murder was committed by Jacob Green, in the living room with a rope.*

## Stretch Goals üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ

Make sure you've commited and pushed a version of your project before starting with the stretch goals.

**_Design_**

- Make the site responsive.
- Spend some time to make it look nice.
- Add images of your suspects and maybe the weapons.

**_Deep-dive_**

- Add the functionality to say something like: "No mystery is yet to be revealed" if you click the reveal button but haven't selected suspect, weapon and room yet.
- Add a fourth deck of card, maybe about when the murder was commited.
