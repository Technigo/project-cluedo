`PROJECT 5` My fourth Technigo Boot Camp Project


**This weekâ€™s project is to create a piece of the famous board game Cluedo.**


The user (who is the game leader and the one that will know all about the murder) should be able to click on three decks of cards, to randomly get a character, a weapon and a room. Then there should also be a button to reveal the mystery.  

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.
