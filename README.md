# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer
This weeks project was to build a game called Cluedo using Javascript (and HTML and CSS).

## The problem
I did the project step by step and asked for help as soon as I faced problems. I still feel that Javascript is really hard to understand and even though people answer my questions on Stack Overflow and the code then works, I don't really get why. I'm gonna try to read my code even more to understand every part of it.
If I had more time I would just spend it on understanding Javascript so that I can hopefully feel better prepared for next weeks project.
