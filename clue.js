/*

**ðŸ”µ  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**
- Style your page
- Site should have three clickable cards and a clickable button.
- You should be able to randomly pick suspects, weapons and rooms.
- You should be able to reveal the mystery.

Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting with the intermediary and advanced goals.


**ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**
- Make your objects more complex :
    - Add `favouriteWeapon` property to each suspect, indicating his favourite weapon. The value of it should be unique id, possibly name of a weapon written lowercase like `favouriteWeapon: "knife"`. Add the same value as an `id` to each weapon in weapon object like `id: "knife"`. It's very important that they have exactly the same value so later on, in **âš«  Black Level** we can compare them.
    - Create `shuffleFavouriteWeapon` function to change favourite weapons of each person
    - Display those properties in mystery card as an info part
- Add loading animations which will signify that generating of a suspect, weapon and room is currently during processing. It should last couple seconds

**âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)**
- Make use of additional `favouriteWeapon` property created in **ðŸ”´ Red level.** Change logic behind generating weapon so it's not completely random anymore and it's more likely to draw weapon which is the favourite one of a suspect generated in previous step. You can do that by creating new array of weapon objects, where favourite weapon object occurs more than one time so probability of picking it is higher.
- Create similar logic for relation between weapon and room - knives are more likely to be found in kitchen, candlestick in living room etc.
